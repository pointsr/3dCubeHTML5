This animation is approached with trigonometry.
The idea is that since a square can perfectly fit into a circle, with it's corners touching the edge, as long as this is true the square will always have the same average position between it's corners.
A good way to think about it is that it's a square within the unit circle, which is 360 degrees. As such each corner on the circle is 90* apart from each other. We are able to calculate the position the other
corners should be in via cos and sin. So in this animation, the squares are recursivly redrawing the image each time adding additional degrees to each square while connecting the sides.
